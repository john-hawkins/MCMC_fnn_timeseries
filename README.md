# MCMC_fnn_timeseries
 
[Extending the MCMC FFN Project by Rohit](https://github.com/rohitash-chandra/MCMC_fnn_timeseries)

Bayesian MCMC Feedforward Neural Network for Time Series Prediction

Changes
* Making Python 3 Compatible

TODO
* Include network structure and data sampling in the MCMC simulation




Requirements: Need data processing done, i. e. reconstruct a univariate time series into a state-space vector using Taken's theorem with a given Dimension and Timelag.
