Bayesian MCMC Feedforward Neural Network for Time Series Prediction

### Changes
* Making Python 3 Compatible
* Commenting the MCMC code to improve comprehension for newbies

### Experiments

* Added a random walk over the samples in the traingdata. This allows us to explore the posterior
distribution over training data importance.

TODO
* Separate Neural Network and make MCMC code re-usable with alternative networks
* Include network structure and input window size in the MCMC simulation
